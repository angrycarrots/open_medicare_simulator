# Cursor Rules for Open Medicare Simulator

## Testing Requirements
- Always run tests prior to adding files to the repository
- Use `uv run pytest` to execute the test suite
- Ensure all tests pass before staging files with `git add`
- If tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding with git operations

## Code Quality
- Use `python -m py_compile` to check for syntax errors after making changes
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation

## Development Environment
- Use `uv` for virtual environment management (not pip)
- Activate the virtual environment with `.venv` before running commands
- Use `uv run` prefix for commands that need the virtual environment

## Git Workflow
- Never run `git commit` commands unless specifically requested
- Do not commit changes without explicit user confirmation
- Only make code changes and wait for permission to commit
- Always run tests and syntax checks before staging files
